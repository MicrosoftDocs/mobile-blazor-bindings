# Debug hybrid apps

Debugging hybrid apps poses a challenge because of the mix of native UI components and web UI components.

## Debugging .NET code in hybrid apps

The .NET code (for example, C#) can be debugging via the standard .NET debugging techniques, such as using Visual Studio to debug the app.

## Debugging web UI in hybrid apps

The web UI code in a hybrid app runs in a platform-specific browser view component. These components support various debugging techniques, typically using common browser developer tools.

Common web-specific errors are:

* Missing/incorrect URLs causing resources to not be loaded
* JavaScript interop not working as expected
