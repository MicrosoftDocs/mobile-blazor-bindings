# Components Reference

## Overview

Applications built using Mobile Blazor Bindings are constructed using UI components. UI components can come from the built-in libraries, 3rd parties, or you can write your own. To author custom components, refer to the [Custom Components](../advanced/custom-components.md) topic.

UI components are used by referencing them with standard Razor syntax. For example:

```xml
<SomeComponent
    Property1="value1"
    Property2="@variable2">
    ... possibly some inner content ...
</SomeComponent>>
```

To learn more about Blazor and Razor syntax, please refer to the [References](../advanced/references.md) topic.

## UI component categories

The built-in components can be divided into several broad categories:

1. Pages. These components occupy all or most of a screen.
1. Layouts. These components are containers for views and other layouts.
1. Views. These components are user-interface objects such as labels, buttons, and sliders.
1. Other specialized components, such as the Application object, Span (for formatted text), and menu items.

## More information
